## Tic-Tac-Toe

I built this app as just a fun experiment to try our [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and [Chakra.js](https://chakra-ui.com/) UI. 
I really enjoyed working with Chakra. The component integration is very easy. I will be using it again in future projects!

## Future additions

This project is a test for me. I am looking to convert the app to a PWA for offline play. ALso will explore usage of sockey.io to make multiplayer online mode.
